\usage{
checkBase(base, convertDates = F, dateFormat = NULL,
  deleteMissing = NULL, deleteErrors = NULL, subjectID = "sID",
  facilityID = "fID", disDate = "Ddate", admDate = "Adate",
  maxIteration = 25, returnReport = FALSE, retainAuxData = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{base}{(data.table).
A patient discharge database, in the form of a data.table. The data.table should have at least the following columns:
    sID: patientID (character)
    fID: facilityID (character)
    Adate: admission date (POSIXct, but character can be converted to POSIXct)
    Ddate: discharge date (POSIXct, but character can be converted to POSIXct)}

\item{convertDates}{boolean indicating if dates need to be converted to POSIXct if they are not}

\item{dateFormat}{character giving the input format of the date character string}

\item{deleteMissing}{(character) How to handle records that contain a missing value in at least one of the four mandatory variables:
NULL (default): do not delete. Stops the function with an error message.
"record": deletes just the incorrect record.
"patient": deletes all records of each patient with one or more incorrect records.}

\item{deleteErrors}{(character) How incorrect records should be deleted:
"record" deletes just the incorrect record
"patient" deletes all records of each patient with one or more incorrect records.}

\item{subjectID}{(charachter) the columns name containing the subject ID. Default is "sID"}

\item{facilityID}{(charachter) the columns name containing the facility ID. Default is "fID"}

\item{disDate}{(charachter) the columns name containing the discharge date. Default is "Ddate"}

\item{admDate}{(charachter) the columns name containing the admission date. Default is "Adate"}

\item{maxIteration}{(integer) the maximum number of times the function will try and remove overlapping admissions}

\item{verbose}{(boolean) print diagnostic messages. Default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{other parameters passed on to internal functions}
