  bestGuess = FALSE, overnight = FALSE, deleteErrors = "", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{base}{(data.table).
A patient discharge database, in the form of a data.table. The data.table should have at least the following columns:
    pID: patientID (character)

\item{convertDates}{boolean indicating if dates need to be converted to POSIXct if they are not}

\item{dateFormat}{character giving the input format of the date character string}

\item{bestGuess}{boolean indicating if the function needs to estimate the best date format, based on the best results from 1000 random records.}

\item{overnight}{boolean indicating if only patient who stayed overnight should be included. TRUE will delete any record with admission and discharge on the same day}

\item{deleteErrors}{character indicating the way incorrect records should be deleted: 
"record" deletes just the incorrect record
"patient" deletes all records of each patient with one or more incorrect records.}

\item{...}{other parameters passed on to internal functions}
